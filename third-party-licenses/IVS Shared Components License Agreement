Readers of this document are requested to submit to Interchangeable Virtual Instruments, Inc. 
(“Licensor”), with their comments, notification of any relevant patent rights or other intellectual property 
rights of which they may be aware which might be infringed by any use of this intellectual property, 
software, or specification (the “Intellectual Property”), as appropriate, and to provide supporting 
documentation.

Copyright © 2002, Interchangeable Virtual Instruments Foundation, Inc. All Rights Reserved. IVI 
Foundation is the exclusive licensee of the “IVI” trademark and the Interchangeable Virtual Instruments 
Foundation, Inc. logo.

Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this Intellectual Property may be the 
subject of patent or other intellectual property right (collectively, "IPR") of third parties. LICENSOR shall 
not be responsible now or in the future for identifying any or all such IPR.

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge and subject to the terms set forth below, to any person 
obtaining a copy of this Intellectual Property and any associated documentation, to deal in the Intellectual 
Property without restriction (except as set forth below), including without limitation the rights to 
implement, use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, and/or sublicense copies of the Intellectual 
Property, and to permit persons to whom the Intellectual Property is furnished to do so, provided that the 
above copyright notice(s) appear in all copies of the Intellectual Property and that each person to whom 
the Intellectual Property is furnished agrees to the terms of this Agreement. If you are not a member of
LICENSOR, your license hereunder is limited to the use of the object code of the Intellectual Property and 
header files necessary to use the object code. If you are a member of LICENSOR, your license extends 
to the source code of the Intellectual Property.

If you modify the Intellectual Property, all copies of the modified Intellectual Property must include, in 
addition to the above copyright notice, a notice that the Intellectual Property includes modifications that 
have not been approved or adopted by LICENSOR.

You may not charge for any sublicense of the Intellectual Property; provided however, that the Intellectual 
Property may be sublicensed together with another product so long as there is no separate charge for the 
Intellectual Property.

THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY 
KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF 
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF 
THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR HOLDERS INCLUDED IN THIS 
NOTICE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE INTELLECTUAL 
PROPERTY WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR THAT THE OPERATION OF THE 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE. ANY USE OF THE 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SHALL BE MADE ENTIRELY AT THE USER’S OWN RISK. IN NO 
EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR OF IPR TO THE 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, OR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, 
INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER RESULTING 
FROM ANY ALLEGED INFRINGEMENT OR ANY LOSS OF USE, DATA OR PROFITS, 
WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE OR UNDER ANY OTHER LEGAL 
THEORY, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION, USE, 
COMMERCIALIZATION OR PERFORMANCE OF THIS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. 

This license is effective until terminated. You may terminate it at any time by destroying the Intellectual 
Property together with all copies in any form. It will also terminate if you fail to comply with any term or 
condition of this Agreement. Except as provided in the following sentence, no such termination of this 
license shall require the termination of any third party end-user sublicense to the Intellectual Property 
which is in force as of the date of notice of such termination. In addition, should the Intellectual 
Property, or the operation of the Intellectual Property, infringe, or in LICENSOR's sole opinion be likely 
to infringe, any patent, copyright, trademark or other right of a third party, you agree that LICENSOR, in 
its sole discretion, may terminate this license without any compensation or liability to you, your licensees 
or any other party. You agree upon termination of any kind to destroy or cause to be destroyed the 
Intellectual Property together with all copies in any form, whether held by you or by any third party.

Except as contained in this notice, the name of a copyright holder shall not be used in advertising or 
otherwise to promote the sale, use or other dealings in this Intellectual Property without prior written 
authorization of the copyright holder. LICENSOR is and shall at all times be the sole entity that may 
authorize you or any third party to use certification marks, trademarks or other special designations to 
indicate compliance with any LICENSOR standards or specifications.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware. The application to this Agreement of 
the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is hereby expressly 
excluded. In the event any provision of this Agreement shall be deemed unenforceable, void or invalid, 
such provision shall be modified so as to make it valid and enforceable, and as so modified the entire 
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. No decision, action or inaction by LICENSOR shall be 
construed to be a waiver of any rights or remedies available to it.

The Intellectual Property is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 12.101 (Oct. 1995), 
consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as 
such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 
227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire the Intellectual 
Property with only those rights set forth herein. 

None of the Intellectual Property or underlying information or technology may be downloaded or 
otherwise exported or reexported in violation of U.S. export laws and regulations. In addition, you are 
responsible for complying with any local laws in your jurisdiction which may impact your right to import, 
export or use the Intellectual Property, and you represent that you have complied with any regulations or 
registration procedures required by applicable law to make this license enforceable.
